The "OMG Tweet" project was created to complete a test task for the "GO IT" company.

It consists of two pages. The Home page is used to greet the user, and the Tweets page displays user cards that can be "followed."

The "back" button and logo will redirect You to the home page.

The "load more" button will display the next three Tweets.

The project uses the following technologies:
HTML, CSS, JS, React, Redux, Parcel-bundler, Babel, Styled Components.
